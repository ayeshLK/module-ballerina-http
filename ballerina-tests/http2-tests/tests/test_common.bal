string largePayload = "WSO2 was founded by Sanjiva Weerawarana, Paul Fremantle and Davanum Srinivas in August 2005, " +
    "backed by Intel Capital, Toba Capital, and Pacific Controls. Weerawarana[3] was an IBM researcher and a founder " +
    "of the Web services platform.[4][5] He led the creation of IBM SOAP4J,[6] which later became Apache SOAP, and was" +
    " the architect of other notable projects. Fremantle was one of the authors of IBM's Web Services Invocation Framework" +
    " and the Web Services Gateway.[7] An Apache member since the original Apache SOAP project, Freemantle oversaw the " +
    "donation of WSIF and WSDL4J to Apache and led IBM's involvement in the Axis C/C++ project. Fremantle became WSO2's chief" +
    " technology officer (CTO) in 2008,[8] and was named one of Infoworld's Top 25 CTOs that year.[9] In 2017, Tyler Jewell " +
    "took over as CEO.[10] In 2019, Vinny Smith became the Executive Chairman.[11] WSO2's first product was code-named Tungsten," +
    " and was meant for the development of web applications. Tungsten was followed by WSO2 Titanium, which later became WSO2 " +
    "Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).[12] In 2006, Intel Capital invested $4 million in WSO2,[13] and continued to invest in " +
    "subsequent years. In 2010, Godel Technologies invested in WSO2 for an unspecified amount,[14] and in 2012 the company " +
    "raised a third round of $10 million.[15][16] Official WSO2 records point to this being from Toba Capital, Cisco and " +
    "Intel Capital.[17] In August 2015, a funding round led by Pacific Controls and Toba raised another $20 million.[18][19]" +
    " The company gained recognition from a 2011 report in Information Week that eBay used WSO2 ESB as a key element of their" +
    " transaction-processing software.[20] Research firm Gartner noted that WSO2 was a leading competitor in the application " +
    "infrastructure market of 2014.[21] As of 2019, WSO2 has offices in: Mountain View, California; New York City; London, UK;" +
    " SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; Sydney, Australia; Berlin, Germany and Colombo, Sri Lanka. The bulk of its research and operations " +
    "are conducted from its main office in Colombo.[22] A subsidiary, WSO2Mobile, was launched in 2013, with Harsha Purasinghe" +
    " of Microimage as the CEO and co-founder.[23] In March 2015, WSO2.Telco was launched in partnership with Malaysian " +
    "telecommunications company Axiata,[24] which held a majority stake in the venture.[25] WSO2Mobile has since been " +
    "re-absorbed into its parent company. Historically, WSO2 has had a close connection to the Apache community, with " +
    "a significant portion of their products based on or contributing to the Apache product stack.[26] Likewise, many of " +
    "WSO2's top leadership have contributed to Apache projects. In 2013, WSO2 donated its Stratos project to Apache. ";
